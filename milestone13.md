<h1>Team Progress</h1>

<h5>Jennifer Phung:</h5>
<p>For this milestone, I looked into Semantics UI to see what other ways we can display favorites rather than having a different page. For now, I experimented with food cards that show up in a grid on the Map page. Although it is not fully implemented, I hope to make the cards clickable and associate them with a connection to a pin on the map. In addition, the foods currently shown are hard coded in since I plan to show my team the look of the favorites list before fully implementing it.</p>

<h5>Aaron Hurtado:</h5>
<p>For this milestone, I fixed a UI bug on the business submission form. I also did some redesign of the map page. For instance, instead of having the map take up the entire
width of the page, I put it inside of a container so that it takes up a fixed amount of width on the page. I also helped with the redesign of the My Favorites section that
is below the map. I'm working on creating a tab menu for the section, I just need to solve a javascript bug before its ready.</p>

<p>The favorites food card grid shown above is a feature that the team is toying with. This feature allows or will allow users to click on the cards and have the pin associated with it show up on the map. In addition, this will help users see where their favorited food is on the map relative to them if they crave it. By clicking on it, the user will be filtering out other pins for a clearer view.</p>
