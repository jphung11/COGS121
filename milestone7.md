<h1>Team Progress</h1>

<h5>Jennifer Phung:</h5>
<p>
For this milestone, I worked with Aaron to create a random database on Firebase and made it so that the FoodFinder feature actually gets food from the database. Now, when we like or dislike on the FoodFinder feature, we will actually be taken to the next food in the database and shown its unique information. In addition, I implemented the rating system which will show the ratings of each food on the food finder according to its rating stored in our database on Firebase.</p>

<p>
For this milestone, I worked on researching how to read the database so that we could fetch the information and put it into the map page (For example, possibility of using the filter function on the database). Also, I researched into how to get rid of the needless need to scroll through the list of food on the map page in favor for a non-scrolling method (like a carousel list). </p>

<h5>Aaron Hurtado:</h5>
<p>
For this milestone, I pair programmed with Jennifer. We set up a database using Firebase and made it such that when our app pulls pictures
of food it gets them from our database instead of just having them locally stored. Thus when you like or dislike a food item, the next
food dish it displays can be more dynamic in the future. Additionally, I set up deploying our web app using Firebase so now we have a live url that we can see our web app on and share with others. The url is in our Readme file in this repo for convenience. </p>

The above two pictures shows our Food Finder feature. The picture on the top is the interface that the user will see and the picture on the bottom is a screen shot of our database on Firebase that the Food Finder feature is pulling data from. These two pictures show the implementation of reading from a pre-set database for this week's milestone.</p>

The above picture shows a new feature that was just implemented. It is a form that allows users (business owners, people who have eaten the food) to add a dish to the database which will be used for the Food Finder feature. We decided to create this new feature in order to utilize having a user based database and to alleviate the problem we had with knowing where to get our data from.</p>

<p>
From the screenshot above, you can see that the locations can actually autofill and query real places. We are doing this with the help of the Google Maps API.</p>

<p>
The screenshot above shows that the form is currently adding to an actual database. The data in the database you see in this picture came from random submissions we made to show that it works.</p>
