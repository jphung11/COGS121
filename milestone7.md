<h5>Jennifer Phung:</h5>
For this milestone, I worked with Aaron to create a random database on Firebase and made it so that the FoodFinder feature actually gets food from the database. Now, when we like or dislike on the FoodFinder feature, we will actually be taken to the next food in the database and shown its unique information. In addition, I implemented the rating system which will show the ratings of each food on the food finder according to its rating stored in our database on Firebase.
