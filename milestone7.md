<h5>Jennifer Phung:</h5>
For this milestone, I worked with Aaron to create a random database on Firebase and made it so that the FoodFinder feature actually gets food from the database. Now, when we like or dislike on the FoodFinder feature, we will actually be taken to the next food in the database and shown its unique information. In addition, I implemented the rating system which will show the ratings of each food on the food finder according to its rating stored in our database on Firebase.

<h5>Tae Hee Kim:</h5>
For this milestone, I worked on researching how to read the database so that we could fetch the information and put it into the map page (For example, possibility of using the filter function on the database). Also, I researched into how to get rid of the needless need to scroll through the list of food on the map page in favor for a non-scrolling method (like a carousel list). 

<h5>Aaron Hurtado:</h5>
For this milestone, I pari programmed with Jennifer. We set up a database using Firebase and made it such that when our app pulls pictures
of food it gets them from our database instead of just having them locally stored. Thus when you like or dislike a food item, the next
food dish it displays can be more dynamic in the future. Additionally, I set up deploying our web app using Firebase so now we have a live url that we can see our web app on and share with others. The url is in our Readme file in this repo for convenience.
