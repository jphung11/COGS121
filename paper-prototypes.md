This paper prototype demostrates after the user has made some swipes to the right or liked some food pictures. The paper prototype on the left shows the resulting screen of a list of restaurants the user can go to based on the food picture they liked. The paper prototype on the right shows the screen after the user selects a restaurant. These two paper prototypes show the main map/geo-related UI and interaction of our application. The user can see where the restaurant is located on the map and can click on the map if they wanted to.

<br>This paper prototype demonstrates a way on liking or skipping between the list of recommendations that is offered to the user. The recommendation screen lists the following: Main picture of the food place, rating, name, genre, and distance from your current location. You can continue to flip through recommendations using the guide me and skip button. The other paper prototype demonstrates the map view of the app in which you can drag the map location around to see which recommended places are near you.
