This paper prototype demostrates after the user has made some swipes to the right or liked some food pictures. The paper prototype on the left shows the resulting screen of a list of restaurants the user can go to based on the food picture they liked. The paper prototype on the right shows the screen after the user selects a restaurant. These two paper prototypes show the main map/geo-related UI and interaction of our application. The user can see where the restaurant is located on the map and can click on the map if they wanted to.
