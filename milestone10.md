<h1>Elevator Pitch</h1>
<h4>What are you trying to do? Articulate your objectives using absolutely no jargon.</h4>
<p>Our app is trying to streamline the process of discovering delicious dishes in one's local community when the user is hungry and is unaware of what they want to eat.</p>

<h4>How is it done today, and what are the limits of current practice?</h4>
<p>It is done today by user's going through an unfiltered list on apps like Yelp and Google Maps until they find something that peaks their interest. Other ways that it is done currently includes the user creating a mental model of their neighborhood and evaluating its available options, or driving around their area until they come across a restuarant they may be interested in.</p>

<h4>What's new in your approach and why do you think it will be successful?</h4>
<p>Our approach brings dishes straight to the user in a friendly and easy to use user experience that will allow them to see all the food possibilites in their area. In addition, our approach also allows the user a guided approach in figuring out what and where they want to eat according to their preferences. We think it will be succesful because people everywhere often come across troubles choosing something/somewhere to eat, especially when they are going out with a group of people. The difference our app will make is that it will help cut down the time and energy that they use to find something/somewhere to eat and allow them to have more time enjoying their meals instead. In addition, it will also help small local restaurants be discovered by their local community.</p>

<h4>Who cares? If you're successful, what difference will it make?</h4>
<p>Individuals who enjoy trying new foods and restaurants in their area will benefit from our app. Generally, people who enjoy eating out but aren't picky eaters will benefit alot. Furthermore, people who have a tough time choosing what they want will get the help they need.</p>
