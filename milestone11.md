For this milestone, I worked on creating a button that would request for your current location then set a different marker on the map based on your current location (it applies to both mobile and web). Also upon clicking, if the gps location has updated, it will remove the previous current location marker and replace it with a new one in the new location while moving the camera so that it is centered on it.
