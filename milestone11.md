<h5>Tae Hee Kim:</h5>
<p>
For this milestone, I worked on creating a button that would request for your current location then set a different marker on the map based on your current location (it applies to both mobile and web). Also upon clicking, if the gps location has updated, it will remove the previous current location marker and replace it with a new one in the new location while moving the camera so that it is centered on it.</p>

<h5>Aaron Hurtado:</h5>
<p> For this milestone, I worked on redisigning the UI of some of our web apps pages using Semantic UI. I redid the UI for index.html (the main page of our app), and business_submission.html page which is where businesses can submit dishes from their restaurants to our database. For the Food finder page I redisgned the page to look more like Tinder. I also created a login page and a signup page.

<h5>Jennifer Phung:</h5>
<p>For this milestone, I worked on creating a new page with the list view of the user's favorited foods. I looked into different ways of visualization and ended up choosing the card list view. Currently, the list of foods shown on the favorited list is hardcoded in. However, we will try to get the favorite button on food finder working so that the favorites list will actually be pulling out data from where it is supposed to.</p>

<p>The screenshots above shows the UI of the favorites list. This feature will hold all the favorited foods of the user. Users can add to this list permanently as to just liking for that one day as a craving.</p>
