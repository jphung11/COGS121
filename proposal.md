<h2>Features</h2>
Even though some people mentioned this app more like Yelp, we're trying to make this app much more useful than Yelp in some certain use-cases.
Here is the list of Core features of the app:

* Main page:
	* Food picture 
	* Like / Dislike button 
	* Search bar
	* Food reviews
* Maps page: this page shows the location of all nearby interested food so we can quickly decide which one is the closest.
* User profile page: This page needs to show user recently chosen food and other personal info / food reviews.
* Settings page: This page needs to show general app settings (notifications/ sounds, change user info/ password,  etc...)
