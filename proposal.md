<h2>Features</h2>
Even though some people mentioned this app more like Yelp, we're trying to make this app much more useful than Yelp in some certain use-cases.
Here is the list of Core features of the app:

* Main page:
	* Food picture : User don't have to decide which type of food they want to eat. These Tinder-like pictures will randomly choose a dish or type of food in nearby restaurant and show up. (Example: Orange chicken of Restaurant A, Fish Taco of restaurant B ) 
	* Like / Dislike button : User can simple choose whether they like that dish or not. If they like it, it will be automatically stored in user's profile, so user can simply look back anytime)
	* Search bar : We may also offer a similar Yelp search bar so user can also find a specifici type of food if they have in mind.
	* Food reviews: Each food picture will also come with a ratings (from other exist apps and reviews, so user can read more info about that dish) 
* Maps page: this page shows the location of all nearby interested food so we can quickly decide which one is the closest.
* User profile page: This page needs to show user recently chosen food and other personal info / food reviews.
* Settings page: This page needs to show general app settings (notifications/ sounds, change user info/ password,  etc...)
