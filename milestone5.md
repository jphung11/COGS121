Tae Hee Kim:
<br> So far for this project, I have implemented the info textbox on the map page of the app as well as helping to finalize our 
"final" vision for our app and what core features it should contain for now.
When the marker of a specific food location is clicked on, an information textbox will pop up providing the name 
and address of the said restaurant. For this milestones, I also researched a bit on how one should link directions to the said marker using 
a 3rd party app (aka Google Maps).<br>

Jennifer Phung:
<br>
For this milestone, I contributed in helping out with the finalizing of our web app idea and figuring out the goals/problems we want to approach with our idea. In addition, I implemented the core interface for the food finder page that the user will be interacting with for a majority of the time they use our app. To show the desired interaction with this page, I have also implemented, through hardcoding with Javascript, a way for users/testers to see what the expected result of clicking the like button would be on the food finder page.<br>

Aaron Hurtado:
<br> So far I have been teaching myself how to use bootstrap in order to help make the UI mobile friendly. I have also been researching other frameworks besides bootstrap such as semantic ui. I have also been working on re-designing the ui and overall flow of the app based on the various feedback we have been getting in order to make our app more user friendly and intuitive. <br>

Trung Do:
<br> For this milestone, I created the map page of the app. The map is hardcoded to show La Jolla right now, but user will be able to choose a random address/ location in the future. I also created a list of food that is chosen by user in the other page, and the map page will show all restaurants in the area that has that specific food. I also implemented 2 buttons that let user switches between current 2 pages. </br>
