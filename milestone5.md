Tae Hee Kim:
<br> So far for this project, I have implemented the info textbox on the map page of the app as well as helping to finalize our 
"final" vision for our app and what core features it should contain for now.
When the marker of a specific food location is clicked on, an information textbox will pop up providing the name 
and address of the said restaurant. For this milestones, I also researched a bit on how one should link directions to the said marker using 
a 3rd party app (aka Google Maps).</br>
