This paper prototype demonstrates a user changing their settings. In this example, the user is changing the search distance the app uses when suggesting food dishes from nearby local restaraunts. Users can change the search distance with a slider tool. The farther to the right the farther distance the app will use, similarly moving the slider to the left decreases the distance.

The paper prototype above shows the simple interface that we could potentially decide to use for our user login.

This paper prototype demonstrates the interactions the user may come across after they have liked a few foods in the FoodFinder. The paper prototype on the left shows a list view of the foods the user has liked as their cravings for the day. It allows the user to have a full view of things they have a sudden craving for and may potentially want to eat. If they wanted a more detailed description of the food left by the user who entered the food into the app, they may click on the specific food. This interaction is then shown in the prototype on the right, which shows what the user could see after they have clicked on the food. The paper prototype on the right shows a modal/page specifically for that food with information from the database. The user then has the option to click the button "Locate this food!" to have it specifically located on the map and be directed to it through our map/geo feature.
