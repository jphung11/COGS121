<p> For this milestone, I worked on modifying the business submission page. I added that so when a business submits a dish and it is successful they get directed to the main index page of our site. I have also been learning how to use Firebase for the goal of having it such that when a busniess submits a dish on our web app, the dish will show up on our list of dishes to show the user.

<p>For this milestone, I worked on trying to get the foodfinder to get the food data from the dishes database that is actually submitted. However, I ran into some problems trying to figure out how to go through the unique ids given to each dish upon submission. As a result, the code I implemented is specifically coded to index the unique id at the moment to see if it works accordingly. Through testing around with that, I found that to index each dish I would need the unique id string and that it will show properly with it. However, I still have the problem of how I can get the dish's info into my code without knowing the unique id.</p>
