<h5>Aaron Hurtado:</h5>
<p> For this milestone, I worked on modifying the business submission page. I added that so when a business submits a dish and it is successful they get directed to the main index page of our site. I have also been learning how to use Firebase for the goal of having it such that when a busniess submits a dish on our web app, the dish will show up on our list of dishes to show the user.
